<h3>The changes to the new Android File System:</h3>
<p>
    Unfortunately due to how Google is making changes to how developers can access files on YOUR phone,
    I had to remove the setting which let's people select a Viewdeo download location. I have remedied this by adding a new feature
    which let's a user 'SHARE' multiple content to any app, which includes File Manager Apps, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Very well written article about the above changes over on XDA: <br/>
    <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-q-storage-access-framework-scoped-storage/">XDA on Storage Access Framework</a>
</p>

<p>I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience, the way I would have had to implement the new Android Storage Access Framework, would have had a very frustrating impact on Viewdeo, if not already.</p>
<h3>SOLUTION:</h3>
<p>
    To Move or Share multiple videos, just long press and select one or more Viewdeos (or Select ALL menu option),
    and Tap the 'Up Arrow' icon or the 'Share' icon. A Share menu or Directory Selector should appear and you can share/move all of the selected files at once to any app or any directory!
</p>

<h3>CAUTION</h3>
<h4>Due to the changes, if you uninstall the App, or clear it's cache, all the downloaded files will also be deleted (Not the old downloads or the moved files)!</h4>
