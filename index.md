# Viewdeo

Viewdeo has gone through some massive changes recently. 
I was busy with development of a whole new Viewdeo App, with awesome new features. All of a sudden a change from Reddit forced me to publish this version which is still a bit unfinished. But all the main functionality that makes Viewdeo, Viewdeo is still working.

# How to use

1. Use the app by sharing links to Viewdeo from other Apps like Reddit, Instagarm, Giphy and Gfycat.
2. Copy links and Paste them on the History Page.
3. Long press files to delete or share

## Free and Full version have Same features

Both the Full and Free version of Viewdeo now have the exact same features, where the Free version will now be carried with Advertising.

## Downloading

Files are Downloaded (With Permissions from you) to your **Download** Folder under ```viewdeo```

## Sharing

Viewdeo downloads and processes Files in the background, and you can share the File from the Notification immediately after.

## Viewing Viewdeos

Files can now be played back on your viewing app of choice.

## History & Copy/Pasting of Links

Compatible Links can be pasted, after being copied from anywhere, by Swiping to the ***History and Copied Links*** page.

Every ***Download*** made by Viewdeo will automatically be saved on this Page for Future Downloads, or reference.

Tapping on an item opens it on the Web, Long Pressing a Link copies it to clipboard if you want to share it somewhere.

History items can be Re-Downloaded or Deleted from history with the Icons on the right.

A Pasted link on the Bottom can be downloaded or saved for later.
