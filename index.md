# Viewdeo

Viewdeo has gone through some massive changes recently. Viewdeo needs a massive rework, Android has changed the way developers can save files.
There is too much to do to make this change, but I'd rather have a wroking app.

Viewdeo can still download files to the app just as always, and you can still share those files to other apps.
Your previous downloaded files should still be where they were downloaded before, but just not visible in the Viewdeo App
CAREFUL: Clearing Viewdeo Cache will delete it's current videos, to save them select and share them to your Files App of choice

## Free and Full version have Same features

Both the Full and Free version of Viewdeo now have the exact same features, where the Free version will now be carried with Advertising.

## Downloading

Files are Downloaded to the Viewdeo App now, you won't see the files in your Photos/Files Apps anymore

## Sharing

Viewdeo downloads and processes Files in the background, and you can share the File from the Notification immediately after.

## Viewing Viewdeos

Files can now be played back on your viewing app of choice.

## History & Copy/Pasting of Links

Compatible Links can be pasted, after being copied from anywhere, by Swiping to the ***History and Copied Links*** page.

Every ***Download*** made by Viewdeo will automatically be saved on this Page for Future Downloads, or reference.

Tapping on an item opens it on the Web, Long Pressing a Link copies it to clipboard if you want to share it somewhere.

History items can be Re-Downloaded or Deleted from history with the Icons on the right.

A Pasted link on the Bottom can be downloaded or saved for later.
